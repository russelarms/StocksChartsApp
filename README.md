![Preview](art/preview.gif)

## Android development

This demo app attempts to use the latest cutting edge libraries and tools. As a summary:

* Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
* UI completely written in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) (see below).
* Uses [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/coroutines-guide.html) and [Kotlin Flow API](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html#flows) throughout.
* Uses many of the [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), including: Room, Lifecycle, Navigation.
* Uses [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/) to show the charts.

## Development setup

The project requires [Android Studio Arctic Fox](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview) release to be able to build the app because the project is written in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

## Jetpack Compose
As mentioned above, this app's UI is completely written in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). Some screens highlighted are:
